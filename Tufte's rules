Tufte’s Rules

1. show data: real data points are clearly visible in all the graphs and it is easy to tell the xy coordinates

2. Figure 3 uses graphics to distinguish per Capita GDP with a ‘$’ and Proportion of house dwellers with an image of a house

3.There is no chart junk in any of these graphics, all information on the graphs have purpose

4.Utilize data ink: Default grey background grid was removed in all and the plots are only outlined by axes. That was done using:

 panel.background = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"))+

5. Axes are all labeled, and Figure 2. uses labels to identify each province’s datapoint

6. Figure 3 tells the complete story of the data analysis showing each province’s per capita GDP and proportion of house dwellers together for easy comparison.

7. Figure 3 also uses multiples to easily compare differences between provinces without having to consult a legend

8.Figure 1 utilizes colours extracted from an image of compost to identify each province’s Per Capita G
